My Attempts at Acing Project Euler.

plan?
=====
My plan is to solve at least 1000 Project Euler problems (starting recently).

It's not how many problems are solved, but how they are solved that I consider important.

In most solutions, I'll try to begin with my own attempts, then later on (after solving
or failing to solve), seek insipiration  / improvements elsewhere.

Objective?
=========
The Objective is not just to complete / rush through the problems, but to use 
them as an opportunity to learn, re-learn and master certain important concepts in Math
and Computer Science that I might have otherwise taken for granted or never learned.

Other Motivation?
=================
Building apps, websites and all seems to not keep my hack fire burning well on many cold nights,
thus, am turning to abstract and fun things now...Math always has hack-value!
